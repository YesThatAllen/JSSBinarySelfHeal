Log Clean-up
    Once 5 archived logs are created, the oldest 4 archives will be deleted
    
Added a random delay to the LaunchDaemon
    There is a 10 minute random delay that was added to the LaunchDaemon.  I wanted to move away from the possibility of every client trying to run a policy in the Self Heal at the same time.
    
Modified the if statements to no longer use a like variable.

    example of this change is below:
    Previous:
    if [[ ${check} =~ "The JSS is available" ]]
    
    Now:
    if [[ ${check} == "The JSS is available" ]]
    
I modified my variables to use grep and cut to extract what I would expect to see in terminal running a command using the JAMF binary.  I then was able to use "==" to match my variable to the expected command output.
