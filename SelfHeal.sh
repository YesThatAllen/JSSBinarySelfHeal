#
#       This script is designed to perform a self heal on the client.  If the client does not have
#	the JAMF Binary, a quickadd package is downloaded and installed.  If the client cannot
#	check in with the JSS, run a policy, or cannot log it's IP address, the client
#	will be enrolled via invitation.  If the MDM profile is not found on the device, the client
#       will get re-enrolled into MDM.  There is a log file that is created to work with the Self Heal
#	process.  The log is located in /Users/Shared/ and is called enrollLog.log.  Five archives are
#	created of this log and stored in /Users/Shared/log_archive.  Once five logs rollover and are 
#	archived, the oldest four logs are deleted and the most recent archive is kept.
#
#	This process will work on a 9.8+ JSS.  It will not work on any JSS version pre 9.8.
